# ChemistryCraft

Introducing realistic chemistry to Minecraft! Builds on the materials and compounds added by ChemLib, adding such things as metallurgy & forgery, oil and natural gas, ore/mineral extraction, reaction temperatures, chemical reactions, industrial chemistry, novel synthesis of items, molarity, interactions of items and blocks with the world, and much more!
This mod was written with compatibility with other mods as its base premise, because who likes making rigid compromises when playing with other mods? It was made specifically for AshleyCraft - my personal modded SMP - seeking to give extensive utility to modpack makers looking to add flare to tech mods!
There are various tweaks which may be configured according to your needs. It also features a module (disabled by default) completely revamping Minecraft's base mechanics! 

Will be updating this soon with stuff regarding using this mod as a dependency~
(Also making this look decent and not like 2004 l m a o)
